This zip file is not needed for developers using 410c with prebuilt SD card image from
96Boards. These are only needed if one is creating the SD card image on their own.
For most developers who work on the application side it is recommended to not flash these 
images via fastboot to prevent device bricking issues.

These bootloaders are used with June 2016 Android M release for 410c.
